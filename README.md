# scoundrel-cli
Recreating the standard deck roguelike game: Scoundrel
## Tutorial & Rules
There's a built in tutorial to walk you through the rules and mechanics of the game, with an option to skip if you know the rules.
The game is rather difficult though, hopefully it doesn't take too long to win your first run!
## Getting Started
1. Clone This repository
```
git clone https://github.com/ReallySoggySocks/scoundrel-cli
cd scoundrel-cli
```
2. Run The Game
```
python3 scoundrel.py
```

And you're all set. Good luck on your runs!
